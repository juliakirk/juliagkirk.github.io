        <p>This project was for my Introduction to Information Science class. This project involved taking Yelp reviews, synthesizing the data, finding patterns, and creating a business plan. This project utilized Tableau and Excel to manage, sort, and visualize data.</p>
        <p>Data analysis was a vital part of this project; looking at a large amount of Yelp reviews made it hard to know what worked well for companies and what could have worked better. Using Excel's filtering features helped to filter what data would be helpful to my project.</p>
        <p>By visualizing data with Tableau, I could narrow down the area I thought would be good to open a coffee shop and ensure competition in the area was manageable.</p>

        <p>This project was for Design Foundations. The objective of the assignment was to create an app you would enjoy using in your free time. I chose to make an interactive museum app where you can look at digital collections, watch videos, and play games. To create this, I looked at what was enjoyable about screen time and what made me feel bad. </p>
        <p>I wanted to design something for phones that does not make you feel like you are wasting time and watching brain-rot content. I enjoy informational content, and I wanted to cater to that.</p>
