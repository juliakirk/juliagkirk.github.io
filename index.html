            <h2>Hey!</h2>

            <p>My name is Julia Kirk, Iâ€™m a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Information Science with a minor in Creative Technology & Design. This website is a portfolio to showcase projects I have done for my classes and personal passion projects. It is a mix of design and technical projects, such as coding, analytics, prototyping, web, and UX design.</p>
            <p>PDFs and explanations of projects can be found under the projects tab. My programming projects can be found on my GitHub page, these projects are mostly data based but there are a few games and more creative projects as well. The design process blog is a website that showcases the design process for more extensive design projects. This blog displays my design process from start to finish, starting with research and ending with the final product, along with all the steps. </p>
